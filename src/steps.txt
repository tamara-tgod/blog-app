1. Install react router from the terminal by inputing:
npm install react-router

2. import BrowserRouter, Routes, Route and Link from the React-router in the App.jsx file

3. Wrap the App.jsx return with BrowserRouter

4. Define the routes for the Home.jsx, DetailPage.jsx and the NotFound.jsx


the :id enables dynamic routing  and we can use it by import the blogData.js file to the App.jsx file and some sort of rendering, perhaps props?
